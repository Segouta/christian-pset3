##

This whole app is constructed out of one single activity, which was an ambitious decision.

One can order through this app, and will receive waiting time information.

When holding down an item in the order menu, one can edit more or delete items. In every dish page there is a discription, price and an image.

When ordering, you see the total price and are asked if you are sure.

One can navigate through the whole app with a navigation bar, and with buttons on top of the layout.

It also saves the order list when one exits the app.
